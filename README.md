Dataset and network of drug-drug interactions (DDIs) including 51 drugs and 206 interactions categorized by type and severity. Useful for visualization, analysis, and predictive modeling in drug safety, clinical research, and personalized medicine.
Drug-Drug Interaction (DDI) Network
Overview

This project focuses on building a Drug-Drug Interaction (DDI) network, which shows how different drugs can interact with each other. Drug-drug interactions are important in clinical research and personalized medicine, as they can affect the safety, effectiveness, and outcome of treatments.

In this work, I compiled a dataset of drugs and their interactions, and categorized them based on interaction type and severity. The goal is to provide a structured dataset that can be used for network visualization, analysis, and predictive modeling.

Dataset Summary

Total drugs: 51

Total interactions: 206

Interaction types:

Pharmacokinetic: 148

Pharmacodynamic: 46

Synergistic: 5

Protective: 4

Beneficial: 3

Severity distribution:

Moderate: 158

Applications

Understanding adverse drug reactions

Supporting clinical decision-making

Building predictive models for drug safety

Network analysis in Cytoscape or similar tools

How to Use

The dataset is provided in CSV format.

You can load it into Python, R, or Cytoscape for analysis and visualization.

Network graphs can be constructed with drug names as nodes and interactions as edges, labeled by type and severity.

Future Work

Expanding the dataset with more drugs and clinical data.

Applying machine learning models for interaction prediction.

Integration with genomic and patient-specific data for personalized medicine.
